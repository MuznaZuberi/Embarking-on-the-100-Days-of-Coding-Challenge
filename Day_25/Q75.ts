//  Question 75: Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.

let x: number = 4;
console.log("Initial_Value : ", x);



// Addition
x += 3;
console.log("Addition : ", x);



// Subtraction
x -= 2;
console.log("Subtraction : ", x);




// Multiplication
x *= 7;
console.log("Multiplication : ", x);



// Division
x /= 2;
console.log("Addition : ", x);
